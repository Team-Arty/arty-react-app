        The visually-imparied heavily rely upon captions for navigating the 
        internet and day-to-day life. Accessibility in the digital realm becomes 
        important in order to facilitate a more inclusive environment for everyone. 
        Image captioning via the standard COCO and Flickr Dataset for real-life objects has been done before - the captions are straightforward and objective.

          <b>But, can objectivity be maintained in the case of captioning artworks? </b>
           
      </p>
      <p>
        Artworks are highly subjective and are open to many interpretations. According to Panofsky‚Äôs three levels of analysis, captions of natural images are of ‚Äùpre-iconographic‚Äù description - an objective view where it is simply listing the elements present within an image. But for artwork images, this type of description does not adequately represent the tonality or accurate description of the painting. In the context of artwork images, it would be more interesting to generate ‚Äùiconographic‚Äù captions that capture the subject and symbolic relations between objects.
